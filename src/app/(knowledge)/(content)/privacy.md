Regreso is an open-source project with this site being primarily a demonstration of its features. We do not use any data you give to the site for advertising, marketing, or sale.

Regreso does not directly collect personally identifying information, with the exception of authentication-related information email addresses, usernames, display names, hashed passwords, and IP addresses. In addition to these factors, use-entered information is collected and stored but **all** information about a user will be deleted forever upon request.

We use services provided by GitHub (Log in with GitHub) in order to more seamlessly enable authentication and integration. Only public information from a GitHub account (user display name, username, and bio) are stored from these services and will be used to create a profile on Regreso.

Your email, GitHub account details, and other authentication information with the exception of username and display name will **never** be shared or visible to other users of Regreso except for admins.

We reserve the right to use provided information for analytics purposes, with the same deletion guidelines from above still applying.

Additionally, Regreso is currently hosted with Netlify, whose privacy policy can be found [on their website](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

For any inquiries about security/privacy, feel free to open a GitHub discussion [question](/help/new) with the tag "privacy/security".

This document will be updated regularly as the platform is updated/grows and a full version history will be available on [GitHub](/repository).
